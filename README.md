# PettiBlog by Nicolas Pettican

Welcome to my blog :smile:!

Here I post articles about Science, Tech and Business as well as my latest work involving science communication. This includes all my illustrations created by Illustrator as well as my animations using the former with After Effects or using Animate (a.k.a. Flash).

See my latest posts on the main page.

Select one of the Science, Tech and Business section to view the posts pertaining to those categories.

View my work on Collection. Here I will post all my illustrations, animations and the code to some of the programs I have worked on.

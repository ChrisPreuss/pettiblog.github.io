## Science and society

Science and technology has progressed enormously in the last hundred years, so much in fact that the general population has found it hard to keep up with discoveries and innovations as the only way they understand science is, as [Nelkin (1995)][nelkin] said, “through the filter of journalistic language and imagery”. Despite this, the impact of science and technology in our daily lives is ever growing. Most people in developed countries walk around with the access to the entire archive of human knowledge in their pocket. It is an amazing feat we have accomplished that still baffles people who were born in the early 20th century, an accomplishment that in my opinion is seriously misused.

As put by Carl Sagan: *“we live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and technology, in which hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology”*. Science has even given us longer life with more comfort, however it has also brought problems such as climate change, energy consumption, hunger and water shortage. Without proper general awareness of science and an appreciation for its progress it is impossible to tackle these problems as a society. Before the general public can form opinions about science policy, energy consumption, waste disposal and social welfare (among others) proper information needs to be provided. As [Hartz and Chappell (1997)][hartz] once said: *“the populous needs as much information as possible to act wisely and intelligently—whether it is about high technology or garbage collection”*. Thus, a common theme in science communication is that scientific knowledge is essential to make effective decisions regarding scientific and technological policies.

Unfortunately, the media has essentially been the only contact the general public has with the rapidly expanding scientific fields, making this a big problem considering that scientists and journalists work in two very different environments which can lead to miscommunication and problematic issues. As [Treise & Weigold (2002)][treise] put it:

> “… scientists are frequently disappointed or angry about media coverage of their research, their fields, or science generally. Journalists report frustration with the difficulties of describing and understanding important scientific findings and with the low levels of support provided by their news organisations for reporting on science news”

The way the science is usually transmitted from the scientists to the media and consequently to the public, varies; however it is almost always transmitted following a linear model. The sources where the media obtain their information include press releases from scientific institutions and organisations, funding agencies, press conferences, public talks given by scientists or by journalists obtaining the information from scientific journals and conferences. A small issue here is that some scientists may not feel comfortable communicating with the media, for fear of having their results simplified or distorted. Fortunately, most scientists are generally happy to expose their work and are becoming more willing to engage with the public about their research. After all, effective communication creates favourable attitudes in the public towards their science, showing what benefits it can offer society which can consequently lead to obtaining more funding.

## Science communication: a definition

However, do not get the wrong idea: science communication is not just a field that encourages researchers to talk more about their work. In fact [Burns et al., 2003][defineterms] **defines scientific communication** as *"the use of appropriate skills, media, activities, and dialogue to produce one or more of the following personal responses to science:*

* *Awareness, including familiarity with new aspects of science*
* *Enjoyment or other affective responses, e.g. appreciating science as entertainment*
* *Interest, as evidenced by voluntary involvement with science or its communication*
* *Opinions, the forming, reforming, or confirming of science-related attitudes*
* *Understanding of science, its contents, processes, and social factors"*

Scientific communication done properly can therefore create public interest in science, confidence to talk about it and ultimately increase public engagement. It is no mystery that with the dawn of social media and increased visual stimulation our latest generation (in which I am included) are losing their attention span. In fact, by now I guess you have realised that **this article is directed more towards the scientific community**, or those who are part of the “scientific culture” given its literacy. By “scientific culture” I mean those who are active scientists, qualified as such or people who, like Elise Andrew (founder of the [IFLS blog][IFLS]), have little background in scientific disciplines yet actively engage in science communication.

## Science vs society

Despite the beauty and amazing advancements brought about by science and technology, society has not always been accepting. In fact this was not only seen in the past but it is well apparent in the present with issues such as the need for vaccination and to tackle climate change being completely rejected by a small percentage of the general public. Additionally, despite science communication being more active in the past decade, some countries have actually decreased the amount of funding given to science.

Moreover, what makes matters worse is the entertainment industry’s renowned tendency to vilify scientists by making them out to be “evil”, reckless, unethical and often creating a disaster or creature that the main character has to tackle or defeat making him/her the hero. Humans are susceptible to visual stimulation, something this industry has taken a great advantage off to make money, with the unwanted consequence of creating a false impression and a huge prejudice on science. This prejudice can be seen in play in areas of science such as vaccination and GM. Just by looking at the results from a [US survey][us-survey] on public opinion about GM food it is apparent that as the knowledge of science decreases, the percentage of people rejecting GM foods increases. The same applies to a [survey done in the EU][eu-survey] in 2010, which found that ~54% of people would reject GM foods, yet only ~56% of the EU population have even heard of this science, with the majority of this percentage actually accepting it.

## Why is science communication important?

Science communication provides a bridge between science and the public, to remedy this lack of general awareness and appreciation of scientific progress. Informing the public about science is essential to make educated decisions in a world that is dependent on scientific and technological progress. It is our duty as scientists to, as [Christensen (2007)][christensen] said, *“prepare an instant meal of science results that can be easily digested by journalists, saving them the labour of scanning hundreds of scientific journals every week and reading thousands of scientific papers just to find that elusive big story”*. It is the responsibility of science communication to bring achievements in fields of science to the attention of important politicians and industry stakeholders in order to keep funding scientific and technological development.

## The future of science communication

However, as it is 2016, news does not exclusively come from media anymore, it also comes from social media. I am talking of course about platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and of course YouTube. I cannot stress enough how important social media has become when it comes to science communication. In fact it has enabled the scientific community and scientific culture to connect directly with the general public. Websites such as [IFLScience][IFLS], YouTube channels such as [asapSCIENCE][asap], [Kurzgesagt][nutshell], [SmarterEveryDay][smart], [MinutePhysics][minute] and many others are doing (in my opinion) a fantastic job in communicating science in an easily digestible way reaching millions. Their success is due to this type of science communication being done visually, which I think is the best suited for the contemporary public, especially for the youngest generation. 

Unfortunately, the subsequent generations are not as involved in social media, and still obtain most of their information from the news media. The issue here, as Claus Madsen puts it, is that *“The majority of stories in the television evening news arise as a result of media placement. In science we are not good enough in this area”*. If we are to reach these generations we must work on our ability to communicate our science. Luckily, science communication is now [starting][core] to be considered a core professional skill that all scientists must have. In fact, there are many [training opportunities][training] available to those who want to develop effective commination skills.

Thus, it is my firm opinion that it is up to us, the scientific community and scientific culture, to actively engage in scientific communication through all possible means of communication. Just like many have already taken the initiative through visual and engaging content, many of us should follow. Science communication is not just important to acquire more funding to continue its advancement but it is vital for the public to be well informed about what they are going to vote for when it comes to global decisions in which science is needed to tackle global issues.

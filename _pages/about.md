Why hello there! So you want to know what this blog is about? Or do you want to know more about me? If you want to know more about me then go back to the [homepage](http://www.pettiblog.com) and click on "More about me" (of course!).

In all seriousness though, I created this blog because it was kind of my childhood dream to have a website where I could publish content for the public to view. In fact, when I was 12, my friends and I started recording "funny" videos using our phones which we planned to publish on our very own website. I still have those videos 😂, they are cringe-worthy! 

So in this past year, due to my lack of computer skills I decided to take a Masters in what I found the hardest subject in my degree: Computational Biology a.k.a. Bioinformatics (crazy right?). Despite the steep learning curve at the beginning, I kept at it, constantly learning in my spare time. And in less than a year I managed to learn to code in 5 different programming languages: Perl, Java, R, Python and JavaScript. I also learned how to create websites using HTML and CSS, hence this website! And as you may have seen by my moving avatar on the left and my other animations on my main website, I also learned how to use Illustrator, Flash and After Effects to express my creative self.

OK, so this blog is like a reflexion of myself. I will publish content about Science, Business and IT, which is essentially my background, what I do and what I really enjoy. I have a big sense of humour, so that might show in some of my articles and especially in my work. Speaking of the latter, I have included a [Portfolio](http://www.pettiblog.com/portfolio) tab where I will upload some of my code, vector art and animations. So follow me on social media with the links at the bottom of the page and you will know whenever I post something new!

I am so busy at the moment that writing articles is going quite slow, so if you have an article you would like to publish here, feel free to contact me! I'm quite open to anything related to my three main topics, and you will get your own avatar designed by me 😉!

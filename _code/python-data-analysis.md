## CSV data

## Excel data

## JSON data

JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is great for modelling and transmitting data as it is language independent just like XML. The data is organised into fields and values and it allows for nested objects and nested arrays. Essentially the "objects" are kind of like dictionaries in Python. If you're curious to learn more, [here](http://www.w2schools.com/json/)'s a good free tutorial I followed.

When using Python, extracting JSON data is not too complicated, however you may need an API token in order to obtain the data you want. So just to keep things simple here is a script I wrote during my Udacity nanodegree. Be warned though, if you want to give it a go be aware that HTTP errors may happen, you may be lucky and have none, or be unlucky like me and have to run the script over 10 times to get it to pull all the data ðŸ˜‚.

```python

#!/usr/bin/env python

import json

BASE_URL = "http://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/"
ARTIST_URL = BASE_URL + "artist/"

                "releases": {"inc": "releases"}}

    # user can choose what artist to search
    id = raw_input('\nWhich artist are you interested in? ')
    return id

    # if there are more artists with the query name
    elige = input('\nWhich one? Enter integer: ')
    return elige

    # this is the main function for making queries to the musicbrainz API

Many people, including myself until a couple of years ago, believe that science and philosophy separated centuries ago and are now completely different fields; one aimed at understanding natural phenomena while concerned with empirically and testable hypotheses, and the other using reason to explore issues such as the nature of reality, limits of our understanding and moral good (among others). Now strictly speaking, they are still distinct activities as they work by two different methods. However, as science dives into the unknown depths of trying to study the world on a subatomic level and to understand the human mind and consciousness, it is beginning to feel like it is working to catch up to the teachings of ancient eastern philosophy.

This became became more apparent after the Mind & Life XXVI conference held at Drepung Monastery in Mundgod, India, on January 18, 2013. On this occasion they were joined by His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, in a discussion about the implications of Quantum Mechanics for our view on reality. It was quite amazing to see how the scientists were talking about the latest in this field of physics while His Holiness responded with philosophical teachings that sounded very similar to what science is starting to comprehend.

> <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> Broadly speaking, although there are some differences, I think Buddhist philosophy and Quantum Mechanics can shake hands on their view of the world. We can see in these great examples the fruits of human thinking. Regardless of the admiration we feel for these great thinkers, we should not lose sight of the fact that they were human beings just as we are."
